give me the values.yaml file for a nginx ingress controller to use nodeports on 80 and 443 for a kubernetes cluster
Output:
service:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30000
  - port: 443
    targetPort: 443
    nodePort: 30001

give me the gcloud command to change the labels of disks in GCP
Output:
gcloud compute disks update-labels DISK_NAME \
  --add-labels=label1=value1,label2=value2 \
  --remove-labels=label3,label4

write me a terraform script to create a GKE cluster in GCP
Output: 
Here is a simple Terraform script that you can use to create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster in Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

Copy code
      # Configure the GCP provider
      provider "google" {
        # Replace with your GCP project ID
        project = "my-gcp-project"

        # Replace with the desired region
        region  = "us-central1"
      }

      # Create a GKE cluster
      resource "google_container_cluster" "my-gke-cluster" {
        # Replace with a unique cluster name
        name     = "my-gke-cluster"
        location = "us-central1-a"

        # Set the desired number of nodes
        initial_node_count = 3
      }

This script uses the google provider to configure the connection to your GCP project. It then creates a GKE cluster using the google_container_cluster resource. You will need to replace some of the placeholder values in the script with your own project and cluster information.

To use this script, you will need to have Terraform installed on your machine. You can then run the following commands to create the cluster:

Initialize the Terraform working directory: terraform init

show me all the values.yaml variable for helm  stable/wordpress
As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I am not able to browse the internet or access specific files on your system. I do not have the ability to provide you with the values.yaml file for the Helm chart stable/wordpress.

However, the values.yaml file is a configuration file that is used to customize the resources that are created by the chart. You can use this file to specify values for various chart settings, such as the WordPress admin password or the name of the database to use. You can find a list of the available chart settings and their default values in the chart's documentation or by running the helm show values command.

Here is an example of how you might use the values.yaml file to customize the WordPress chart:

Copy code
# Set the WordPress admin password
wordpressAdminPassword: "mysecretpassword"

# Set the name of the database to use
database:
  name: "mydatabase"
You can then use this values.yaml file when you install the chart using the helm install command. For example:

Copy code
helm install stable/wordpress --values values.yaml
Keep in mind that this is just an example, and you will need to customize the values to fit your specific needs. For more information, you can check the chart's documentation or ask for assistance in a Helm or Kubernetes forum or community.
